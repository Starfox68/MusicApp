537348^Chapter 1^https://images.genius.com/07311f41bf5c97e1fea1995c9793df31.211x211x1.jpg^^                                              CHAPTER I    THE towers of Zenith aspired above the morning mist; austere towers of steel and cement and limestone, sturdy as cliffs and delicate as silver rods. They were neither citadels nor churches, but frankly and beautifully office-buildings.    The mist took pity on the fretted structures of earlier generations: the Post Office with its shingle-tortured mansard, the red brick minarets of hulking old houses, factories with stingy and sooted windows, wooden tenements colored like mud. The city was full of such grotesqueries, but the clean towers were thrusting them from the business center, and on the farther hills were shining new houses, homes—they seemed—for laughter and tranquillity.    Over a concrete bridge fled a limousine of long sleek hood and noiseless engine. These people in evening clothes were returning from an all-night rehearsal of a Little Theater play, an artistic adventure considerably illuminated by champagne. Below the bridge curved a railroad, a maze of green and crimson lights. The New York Flyer boomed past, and twenty lines of polished steel leaped into the glare.    In one of the skyscrapers the wires of the Associated Press were closing down. The telegraph operators wearily raised their celluloid eye-shades after a night of talking with Paris and Peking. Through the building crawled the scrubwomen, yawning, their old shoes slapping. The dawn mist spun away. Cues of men with lunch-boxes clumped toward the immensity of new factories, sheets of glass and hollow tile, glittering shops where five thousand men worked beneath one roof, pouring out the honest wares that would be sold up the Euphrates and across the veldt. The whistles rolled out in greeting a chorus cheerful as the April dawn; the song of labor in a city built—it seemed—for giants.    II    There was nothing of the giant in the aspect of the man who was beginning to awaken on the sleeping-porch of a Dutch Colonial house in that residential district of Zenith known as Floral Heights.    His name was George F. Babbitt. He was forty-six years old now, in April,1920, and he made nothing in particular, neither butter nor shoes nor poetry, but he was nimble in the calling of selling houses for more than people could afford to pay.    His large head was pink, his brown hair thin and dry. His face was babyish in slumber, despite his wrinkles and the red spectacle-dents on the slopes of his nose. He was not fat but he was exceedingly well fed; his cheeks were pads, and the unroughened hand which lay helpless upon the khaki-colored blanket was slightly puffy. He seemed prosperous, extremely married and unromantic; and altogether unromantic appeared this sleeping-porch, which looked on one sizable elm, two respectable grass-plots, a cement driveway, and a corrugated iron garage. Yet Babbitt was again dreaming of the fairy child, a dream more romantic than scarlet pagodas by a silver sea.    For years the fairy child had come to him. Where others saw but Georgie Babbitt, she discerned gallant youth. She waited for him, in the darkness beyond mysterious groves. When at last he could slip away from the crowded house he darted to her. His wife, his clamoring friends, sought to follow, but he escaped, the girl fleet beside him, and they crouched together on a shadowy hillside. She was so slim, so white, so eager! She cried that he was gay and valiant, that she would wait for him, that they would sail—Rumble and bang of the milk-truck.    Babbitt moaned; turned over; struggled back toward his dream. He could see only her face now, beyond misty waters. The furnace-man slammed the basement door. A dog barked in the next yard. As Babbitt sank blissfully into a dim warm tide, the paper-carrier went by whistling, and the rolled-up Advocate thumped the front door. Babbitt roused, his stomach constricted with alarm. As he relaxed, he was pierced by the familiar and irritating rattle of some one cranking a Ford: snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah. Himself a pious motorist, Babbitt cranked with the unseen driver, with him waited through taut hours for the roar of the starting engine, with him agonized as the roar ceased and again began the infernal patient snap-ah-ah—a round, flat sound, a shivering cold-morning sound, a sound infuriating and inescapable. Not till the rising voice of the motor told him that the Ford was moving was he released from the panting tension. He glanced once at his favorite tree, elm twigs against the gold patina of sky, and fumbled for sleep as for a drug. He who had been a boy very credulous of life was no longer greatly interested in the possible and improbable adventures of each new day.He escaped from reality till the alarm-clock rang, at seven-twenty.    III    It was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively produced alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral chime, intermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. Babbitt was proud of being awakened by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as creditable as buying expensive cord tires.    He sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and detested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family, and disliked himself for disliking them. The evening before, he had played poker at Vergil Gunch's till midnight, and after such holidays he was irritable before breakfast. It may have been the tremendous home-brewed beer of the prohibition-era and the cigars to which that beer enticed him; it may have been resentment of return from this fine, bold man-world to a restricted region of wives and stenographers, and of suggestions not to smoke so much.    From the bedroom beside the sleeping-porch, his wife's detestably cheerful Time to get up, Georgie boy, and the itchy sound, the brisk and scratchy sound, of combing hairs out of a stiff brush.    He grunted; he dragged his thick legs, in faded baby-blue pajamas, from under the khaki blanket; he sat on the edge of the cot, running his fingers through his wild hair, while his plump feet mechanically felt for his slippers. He looked regretfully at the blanket—forever a suggestion to him of freedom and heroism. He had bought it for a camping trip which had never come off. It symbolized gorgeous loafing, gorgeous cursing, virile flannel shirts.    He creaked to his feet, groaning at the waves of pain which passed behind his eyeballs. Though he waited for their scorching recurrence, he looked blurrily out at the yard. It delighted him, as always; it was the neat yard of a successful business man of Zenith, that is, it was perfection, and made him also perfect. He regarded the corrugated iron garage. For the three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth time in a year he reflected, No class to that tin shack. Have to build me a frame garage. But by golly it's the only thing on the place that isn't up-to-date! While he stared he thought of a community garage for his acreage development, Glen Oriole. He stopped puffing and jiggling. His arms were akimbo. His petulant, sleep-swollen face was set in harder lines. He suddenly seemed capable, an official, a man to contrive, to direct, to get things done.    On the vigor of his idea he was carried down the hard, dean, unused-looking hall into the bathroom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chains of corruption raping endless families of their mortal slab. Taking all it can grab, with the children in their hand. I cannot let this stand. Fornicating?! Visions of molesting the meek, raped and bled. Prayed for their lives, their cries we all denied. Revocation of their fate. Steel toed boots to decimate and then castrate. Smashing chest plates. Obscene, unclean, defeat this beast. Hack up all their bodies for a cannibal cuisine. Determined are these fiends will. Set to kill, arousing thrill. Brain washed slaves to the righteous book that brands free will. Treasure lies, deceiving mindless parasites, to rise up in the ranks of this cult to reach supremacy. Contorted perception, a vile infection. This pit of slime moves within the dark of night. Stealing the light within the mind. Strip for the beast and be dehumanized. The time has come for me to separate, this vermin’s plague from this dying world. Condense his skull, fragments remain. Surrounding, intriguing. Mutilation makes your stomach wrench. Now you’ll yearn for more, indulge in rape, torture, filth and gore. Search for the purest fulfillment in life, surprising it waits on the blade of a knife. Visions of molesting the meek. Raped and bled. Prayed for their lives.

I am much delighted with the idea of going home, but dont expect to realize it until fairly there, within sight & sound of you all. I wonder if you know, that today is the seventh Sabbath, since I left home. Quite a long time since I have see you all and the many good people in Amherst. Bowdoin, tells me of no news, excepting the following. Cherries are fast getting ripe & the new generation attended the Senior Levee, a short time since, both of which facts, were received by me, with proper resignation. Surely, things must have changed in quiet, peace loving Amherst.Jane Humphrey. wishes me to tell you that she would be happy to accept your invitation, but as Misses. Lyon & Whitman, are not willing & tell her it will lower her classification if she goes, she feels obliged to decline. I believe, Miss. Fiske. has given up the idea of going also. Father wrote that you were expecting Uncle Joel. Norcross at your house, yesterday and you are probably having grand times among yourselves. Louisa. Dickinson & Antoinette. Baker., went home on Friday last & expect to return tomorrow morning. She could not have had permission, had it not been that her friends from New. York. were there and desired to see her. Bowdoin. had quite an adventure seeing me, which he will tell you. Yesterday afternoon I had a call from a sister of Tutor Lewis Greene's, who has been teaching school in Brooklyn & is quite intimate in Aunt Kate's family. She said Aunt. Catharine. was coming to Amherst, next week. I received a long letter from Cousin Zebina Montague, about a fortnight since & answered it last week. I want much to see you all & think Monday & Tuesday will be rather dull days to me. I do wish they might seem as long to you. One thing in your note made me feel badly, & you can guess what it was. Give my best love to Father, Mother, Viny & Uncle Joel, if he is indeed at our house. Tell Viny, the letter she sent me last, was not received & I guess it was lost on the way. I hope a similar fate will not befall any others, I should otherwise obtain. I have an action against John. Spencer, which you shall hear of at my coming. Emily & I shall be all ready at precisely 5. o,clock.                                                                                            Your aff. Sister.                                                                                                           Emilie.My love to Abby & Mary. What an honor, Viny had in attending the Levee. I hope she bears that & others similar, in becoming humility. Cousin Emily. can hardly eat or sleep, so perfectly happy is she with the idea of going home with me to the great Festival. She sends her love to all the household.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

530347^After Trying a Certain Book^https://images.genius.com/896faf28d1d41c0758e5e0ff4a56afcd.1000x801x1.jpg^^    I tried to read a beautifully printed and scholarly volume on the Theory of Poetry, received by mail this morning from England—but gave it up at last for a bad job. Here are some capricious pencillings that follow'd, as I find them in my notes:    In youth and maturity Poems are charged with sunshine and varied pomp of day; but as the soul more and more takes precedence, (the sensuous still included,) the Dusk becomes the poet's atmosphere. I too have sought, and ever seek, the brilliant sun, and make my songs according. But as I grow old, the half-lights of evening are far more to me.    The play of Imagination, with the sensuous objects of Nature for symbols and Faith—with Love and Pride as the unseen impetus and moving-power of all, make up the curious chess-game of a poem.    Common teachers or critics are always asking What does it mean? Symphony of fine musician, or sunset, or sea-waves rolling up the beach—what do they mean? Undoubtedly in the most subtle-elusive sense they mean something—as love does, and religion does, and the best poem;—but who shall fathom and define those meanings? (I do not intend this as a warrant for wildness and frantic escapades—but to justify the soul's frequent joy in what cannot be defined to the intellectual part, or to calculation.)    At its best, poetic lore is like what may be heard of conversation in the dusk, from speakers far or hid, of which we get only a few broken murmurs. What is not gather'd is far more—perhaps the main thing.    Grandest poetic passages are only to be taken at free removes, as we sometimes look for stars at night, not by gazing directly toward them, but off one side.    (To a poetic student and friend.)—I only seek to put you in rapport. Your own brain, heart, evolution, must not only understand the matter, but largely supply it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well see your time elapsed.Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trapped?Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crackWas introduced to hispanic communities and blacksBut then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attentionCause your daughter’s on it and you can't hide it.Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded;You scared, she scared, they scared, I saidThey scared, they scared to talk about itBout it bout it bout it bout it bout it *fades*If you scared, say you scaredAndre begins after 1:38 of a lackluster rap song and performs a verse that simply flew over most listeners’ ears; it is the quintessential performance to demonstrate his stage stealing abilities.  The opening “paragraph indent” is an instant way to set the following lines up as something different than the preceding lines.  “I make intense sense” is a use of slang to inform the listener his verse will be exploring a topic with indisputable logic.  Andre grabs one’s attention and alerts him to look for an argument with this opening line, which allows the line, “Niggas on that Gill Scott dope (hint hint),” to impart its intended meaning to the attentive listener.  The word “dope” in urban slang has traditionally primarily meant heroin – and subsequently caused this verse to be misunderstood by many. “Dope” is taking the place of the last name of “Gil Scott” which is Heron, thus many attempted to combine the meaning of “dope” and its replacement of Heron to state the line meant “Niggas on that Heroin.”  This interpretation falls apart upon the most cursory inspection as it makes no sense in context. However, “dope” also has two other common definitions in urban slang.  Those not familiar with slang often assume it means marijuana and subsequently use it to mean marijuana; while this meaning is still generally regarded as incorrect, its prevalence warrants mention.  It is also used as an adjective meaning extremely cool or good (which is likely what lead to the incorrect use of the term to mean marijuana, as referring one might refer to very good weed as being “dope”).Here Andre uses it to state that he and his friends believe Gill Scott Heron was cool. Gill Scott Heron is today known as the godfather of Hip-Hop and he infused his music with political messages that criticized Black Revolutionary hypocrisy, pointed out white middle class America’s ignorance to the situation of inner-city communities, urged the inner city to work to improve its condition and in his latest recordings directly addressed upcoming rap stars to plead with them to work for improvement of the life of others in the inner city instead of perpetuating or glorifying the lifestyle.  Outkast, the duo of which Andre is one half, often addressed these same issues and the “(hint hint)” informs the listener to keep Gill Scott Heron’s messages in mind.“At age fifteen they start smoking Billy Clint’” is an image of an inner city youth beginning to smoke marijuana (“Billy Clint’” meaning Bill Clinton, who said: “When I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn’t like it. I didn’t inhale and never tried it again”).  Andre then jumps the age to twenty-one to illustrate that despite Gill Scott Heron’s admonitions those in the inner city are still not working to escape and improve the inner city.  The youth here entered High School at 15 where he may have escaped through academics or athletics (or other methods) but instead smoked weed and has found himself 21 and still caught in the inner city (“Hey hey hey what’s the haps? Well see your time elapsed”).  “Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trapped” requires slang knowledge once again – the trap or trapping refers to both the inner city and the drug game; Andre is pointing out the inner city/drug game is an actual trap and now that our character has failed to escape in the 15 to 21 year old time period he now must depend on someone else to free him.  This issue troubles the 21 year old (“Baboon on your back” replacing the idiom monkey on your back, which refers to having something constantly trouble one) but he is powerless.Andre then moves on to a new point of Gil Scott Heron’s but this time expands upon it.  Heron believed curing the middle class of their ignorance would incite a response and solution of the issues in the inner city.  Andre takes his audience beyond inner city blacks by including “Hispanic communities” when discussing the crack epidemic.  He specifically states “it got everyone’s undivided attention” after it “spread to white” however, it is unlikely this is a race criticism as Andre never expresses racial statements in this way in other material.  It is more likely “white” simple works better than “middle-class.”  More important is the fact that the “crack” didn’t get “undivided attention” until it reached outside of inner city communities, as this illustrates the middle class is still ignorant about the inner city.Andre expands upon Heron’s points here as well by noting the middle class did not know how to respond to the epidemic and was simply “scared to talk about it.”  Andre changes the song’s refrain’s meaning by starting this repetition of “scared” early.  When the listener reaches “if you scared, say you scared,” it becomes an admonition to acknowledge problems.  Andre expands Heron’s message to every race, illustrates the continuing problem, and then points out and corrects the message’s error.  It is not merely enough to be aware of a problem – one must actually acknowledge and discuss the problem.  Being scared of the crack epidemic solves nothing, so “if you scared, say you scared.” Only then can the problems be solved.  In thirty-eight seconds, Andre takes a simple rap song and packs in a fully realized political message.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

542008^Matthew 3 (NRSV) (P4)^https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1668632954^^Matthew 33In those days John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming, 2“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” 3This is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, “The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.’” 4Now John wore clothing of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 5Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea were going out to him, and all the region along the Jordan, 6and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.7But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 8Bear fruit worthy of repentance. 9Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. 10Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 11“I baptize you with water for repentance, but one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 12His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”13Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. 14John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” 15But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. 16And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. 17And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She's your girl friend?! She's a girl and a friend? Dont humanize the enemy, Ted.But nice to meet you.Barney Stinson.And yet, in the fall of 2009, he was the one with the girlfriend.Go ahead.Open it.Open it! Open it! Open it! Open it!

I'm giving you my porn.Now that things are so great with Robin, I don't need it anymore.Wow, you are voluntarily giving up your porn? You really are serious.Yeah, well, that's obvious.What does that mean? Oh, nothing, it's just, you know, you got relationship gut.What?! No, I do not got relationship gut. That is ridiculous.It's no big deal.I mean, once you're dating someone, it's natal to let things go a little bit.Trust me, we've been there.Yeah.Boy, did i pudge you out for a while.Well, we should get going.Good-bye, my sweet, beloved friends.You have always been there for me.You'll be missed.He's talking to the porn.Oh.Bye, Robin.See you, Robs.Bye, guys.God, look at these videos.Space Orgy? Horny Co-Ed Surprise Party 23? You'd think after the first 22 parties, the co-eds wouldn't be surprised anymore.So, uh we can get rid of these for you.Yeah.No.No-no-no-no-no-no.It's not a problem.I'll-I'll take care of them.Are you sure? Mm-hmm.I mean, no biggie.We can just swing by the back alley and drop the box in the Dumpster.I see six of the words you just id on this video label.Seriously, it's not a big deal.I will take care of it.No, 'cause I, I mean Leave them! Okay.You know, in a way it sad, right? I mean, Barney's giving up his porn.He's got relationship gut.They eat at the same diner every night.It-it's, like, the end of Barney Stinson as we know him.Yeah, well, so what? They're happy.Yeah, well, we gotta go.Later.Bye.Bye-bye.So what'd you get? I got Squat.What are you? I thought I saw you take one.Yeah, I did.It's called Squat.Hmm ArchiSexTure.That is not how you spell Buckminster Fuller. Kids, pornography is bad, and so I was getting rid of that vile pornography right away I am getting rid of this vile pornography right away.when something terrible happened.Oh, no.Oh, no.Oh, no.Oh, no.ArchiSexTure Hello, Ted.If you are watching this tape-- and I knew you'd pick this one-- then you are now in possession of my porn.This can only mean one of two things: either I'm dead, or m in a committed relationship.If I'm dead, I want you to honor my memory by taking my body to the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie's.I want to dance.I want to have sex with a girl.And I want to go fishing.If, on the other hand, I'm in a committed relationship, then as your best friend, I have only one request: please, for the love of God, get out of it! .Corrected by Alex28 I might look happy, but don't believe it.Barney Stinson is meant to be single.So please, if you value my best-friendship-- that's right, Marshall, I'm his best friend, how does that feel?-- then get me out of this.And finally, since you were expecting some porn No, no, no baby, don't worry.The flashing green light means it's off.Are we sure he was finished talking? Look, there's reason we should take this seriously, right? Of course not.This is an old tape.Barney is happy with Robin.But over the next couple weeks, I started to notice things.Barney and Robin stopped having crazy adventures.So what'd you guys do last night? I wanted to go to a concert.He wanted to go to a party.Obviously, we couldn't do what just one of us wanted, so we just stayed in, watched a movie on It was Legen-- wait for it-- ds of the Fall.Legends of the Fall! It was okay.Barney stopped being himself.Hey, Barney, I'm, uh, I'm chatting up this girl over there, and I could use a little help landing the plane.Sorry, Ted, I'm my own wingman tonight.And Robin got annoyed at everything he said.So, how are u two? So great.Oh shut up.Relationships are the best.Shut up.Shut up, shut up, shut up The sharing, the compromise, The monogamy, can't beat it.Catchphrase! Yes! But the worse they got I'm full sweetie.the more they kept saying things were great.Now, the truth is, Barney and Robin only kind of let themselves go a little bit.But I swear, after a few more weeks, to us, they seemed like this.I'll be there in a minute.Hey.They're killing each other.They love each other.Barney and Robin love each other, but they're not Barney and Robin anymore.They're the fat guy and the old lady.My favorite '70s detective show.Look, it's so ear.Barney's been overeating because he hates being tied down like this.And Robin's stressing out because she hates what Barney's turned into.No, they're a perfect match.Well, maybe that's the problem.Maybe they're too similar.It must be tough having two alpha dogs in one relationship.We have two alpha dogs in our relationship.Sure we do, sweetie.If they're not happy, why don't they just break up? Because they're too stubborn.Neither one of them wants to be the first to admit that they want out.They're playing Relationship Chicken.I think Barney ate the relationship chicken.Ted, it's just a rough patch.It takes time getting used to being with someone else.And they're both What the nice word for selfish? Independent.Independent.Every relationship goes through this.It's true, um, I have this astronaut friend-- totally loved his fiancée.And then, the day before his mission she caught him with, like, four other chicks, a couple of dudes.Things got really tense.Um, finally, she ended up sneaking onto the space shuttle Are you talking about Space Orgy? Yes, I am.Ted, it's just a rough patch.Just let things run their course.She's right.But Two-to-one, Ted.Leave them alone So I did leave them alone.But that weekend Have you noticed how beef ribs used to always be disgusting, and then recently, they found a way to make them really delicious instead? Okay, Barney, I'm going to go ahead and ask you this head-on Are you happy with Robin? Are you kidding?! How could I not be happy with Robin? It's Robin! So are you happy? I can't believe you would even ask me that.I mean, yes, we fight all the time, but you know what they say about relationships: Every moment's a battle.So are you happy? Do you know what goes hand in hand with fighting? The makeup sex.Which is different when you're in a loving, long-term relationship.Heads we have sex, tail we order a whole pizza and just lay here moaning.Oh, great.Let the coin decide.Which was pizza again? Tails.It was tails.Sex-- am I right? Thank God that's mostly over.I'm still hungry.You hungry? We have to break them up.You're right.Barney and Robin are miserable together, but they're too stubborn to admit it.So we had to get them to break up.How do we do that? We unleash the Kraken.Kids, as you know, earlier that year I'd learned that Lily had broken up not one, not two, but seven of my past relationships.Forget it.I'm retired.I'm out of the game.But nobody's better than you.I'm telling you, I swore off that rocket.I've gone legit.I'm a matchmaker now.Set me up with someone.Whoa, I'm just starting out.Please.You've, you've got to break them up.This relationship is killing them.I know it is, but I've learned my lesson.No more interfering.Let things run their course.It's two-to-one.Yes, but t one is me.All right, we don't need her.We can break them up on our own.How? Okay remember when Robin and I were dating? What was the one big thing that really freaked her out? No, no, no, no, no--Ted, you can't.No! No-no-no! What are you talking about? This! This is what I'm talking about.What is this doing in my champagne? If we make Robin think for even a second that Barney is proposing, she'll lose it and they'll break up.That's crazy.Why don't we just, uh, like, lead Barney into temptation? We'll find some hot woman hit on him Okay, the ring thing.Stakeout van.What? We should've gotten a stakeout van.We could've ordered pizza, look through big binoculars and said, This ain't what I signed up for, stuff like that.Shh, here comes the waiter.Please shut up.What? Oh, I thought you said something, sorry.Is that an engagement ring? Are you? Oh, no.No.That is not .They must have delivered it to the wrong table.Can you imagine us getting married? Well, we are committed to each other.Most of your stuff is already at my apartment.It might make taxes easier.It'd speed up your citizenship.Scherbatsky is so hard to spell.My mom would be so happy.Yeah, I guess so.Yeah, no reason not to.We're getting married! Not so loud, geez.What did you do? I am furious right now! This is so wrong! Lily, will you be my maid of honor? Oh, my God! I would love to! Are you out of your mind?! You knew they were playing Relationship Chicken, And what did you do? You put an engagement ring in front of them! Okay, that's it.I'm taking over.Coming out of retirement for one, last breakup.Oh-ho! All right.Oh, yes! How are we going to do it? These guys are in so deep, just one fight ain't going to do it.We need to reignite the four biggest fights they've ever been in all at once.Number one: The Battle of the Dirty Dishes.Number two: The Ex-Girlfriend Conflict.Hey.Don't you know that girl over there? No, I don't think .No, in fact, I have definitely not-- Oh, hey, it's Meg.Wow, I am certainly not comparing you two in my mind right now.Whoops! Hey, will you get that for me, please? Really? What's the problem? I'm not Why do you keep-- You're embarrassing me in public.Youre constantly putting me in these positions.Oh, my God Number three: The Star Wars Altercation.Isn't it time you got rid of your stupid doll? It's not a doll.It's a Storm Trooper.Uh, he's wearing a diaper.It's not a diaper, Robin, it's protective armor.Storm Trooper? More like storm-pooper.Stop it.Oh! Oh, it sounds like your storm-pooper here needs a changing.Okay, you know what? I'm sick of it.What? I didn't say anything.I'm sick of the jokes-- the joke about the magic, the joke about the stormtrooper I can't I can't joke? And of course the biggie: The Canadian/American War.Thank God that song's over.Who the hell was that old lady singing? Okay, you know that Neil Young is my favorite musician.Right.Now, was that the same old lady who played Archie Bunker's wife in All in the Family, or just sound-alike? Neil Young is a Canadian treasure.Do not make fun of Neil Young.Robin, I would never make fun of a defenseless old lady with vocal cord paralysis ever.Oh, here we go.In public? Really? In public? Yeah, in public.I'll go there.What's the problem? Everything I say We're gonna have a fight in public? I got it.I got it.We e-mail them pictures reminding them of each of these fights.You child.Here's how it goes down.They're at the diner LILY: First, rekindling the Canadian-American debate, Ontario native Alan Thicke stops by the table.TED & MARSHALL: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Alan Thicke? Oh, right.Robin knew him back when she was a singer.Yeah, and they still keep in touch.I already got his number off her phone.Seriously amateurs.LILY: So Alan Thicke restarts the Canada-U.S.fight.Right at that moment, Crazy Meg shows up.Then, a stormtrooper happens to walk by the window.And just when they can't take anything more, a busboy walks by with a tray full of what? Dirty dishes.Lily.This is your masterpiece.We're getting a stakeout van! A station wagon? Really? You rented a station wagon? Yeah, a van cost, like, 25 bucks more.A station wagon? Greetings, Will Robinson! Where's the birthday boy or girl? Hey, climb on in.What the hell is this? Oh, they didn't have any stormtroopers, so I had to get a different robot; this'll still work.Different robot? Stormtroopers aren't robots.Of course they're robots! Must kill Luke Skywalker. Um, nobody says that in Star Wars at all, ever.That's a really lousy robot voice, honey.Someone order an extra large sausage? Hey, one of Barney's videos starts off just like that.Hey, guys, Barney's ordering five of something.I don't know if it's gonna fit in here.Okay, now you're just quoting the video.Still ordering.Waiter's taking out a second pad.Yeah, okay, well, we need it in here.We're on a stakeout.Shouldn't you be in a van? Thank you! A van cost more.Score me a slice, Will Robinson! No, no-no-no! You get a stain on that costume, they're gonna charge us.Dude, will you just chill about money? Yeah, let the stormtrooper have a slice.BOTH: It's not a stormtrooper! Hi, Lily Sorry I'm late.I was looking for a van.Thank you! $25! So should I go say hi to Robin? Oh, not yet; get in the car.Okay, so wait, wait, wait.When they blew up the Death Star, knowing full well there were thousands of stormtroopers on it, those were people? It was called the Death Star, baby.They knew what they were getting into.Look, I don't want to play the I'm Alan Thicke card, but I really do have a dinner to get to.Someone has got to take this sausage! Okay, were you in that video? Were you the guy with the farmer tan? Jonesin' for some 'za, Will Robinson! Come on, I'm Alan Thicke! This ain't what I signed up for.Hey! That's what Hey, you know what? Everyone, stop! Alan Thicke, shut up! Marshall, it's a station wagon.Get over it! Ted, stop talking about porn! And for the love of God, somebody get the stormtrooper some pizza! TED & MARSHALL: It's not a stormtrooper! Crap! They see us! Danger! Danger! Are you sure they saw us? Yes.Hey! Can I go talk to Barney now? I'm so excited! Do you really think he's going to propose to me? Oh, honey Forget it, Crazy Meg, we've been made.If we try anything now, they're going to know it's us.I, I think we should all just go home No! This is my masterpiece.So what if they saw us? It'll still work.Stop it.We'll think of something else.Let me repeat: I am Alan Thicke. You're Alan Thicke?! No.Alan Thicke, you're up.Get on out there.NARRATOR: And so, Lily followed through with her plan.First, Alan Thicke.Followed by Crazy Meg.Then, the robot.And finally, the dirty dishes.But by the end of it LILY: They're kissing? They shouldn't be kissing! Why isn't this working? Because they're in love.It really was just a rough patch.What the hell am I doing? This whole thing was a mistake.So, uh, any of you dudes want to get high? I never thought I'd be saying this tonight, but to Barney and Robin, the happy couple.That was the moment we learned that relationships take hard work, but eventually, everything will work out.Oh, hey! Where's Barney? Uh, we broke up.And that was the moment we unlearned that other lesson we had just learned a few seconds earlier.You see, earlier that night, when Lily thought Barney and Robin had spotted her, this is what they really saw.Why do that fat guy and old lady keep sta? Oh, my God.That's us! Look at us.Did always look this awful? Robin, I'm not happy.I mean, I wish I was.Nothing would make me happier than being happy, but I'm not.What are we doing wrong? We love each other.I mean, if this don't work, what will? We're so similar.We both like scotch.We're both awesome.You know, maybe that's it.Maybe there's just too much awesome here.Exactly.Two awesomes cancel each other out, and I'm tired of being cancelled out.Me, too.Are we breaking up? I think so.Ah, crap.Now comes the next part.The part where you and can't go back to being friends.Well, maybe this isn't a breakup.Maybe this is two friends getting back together.ALAN THICKE: Robin! Ooh! Alan Oh, it's always so great to see a fellow hoser.Yes! Oh, is true.MEG: Barney! Good news! I forgive you for the whole restraining order thing.Uh, hi.Whoa, is that a stormtrooper? That's not a stormtr You want to get out of here? Yeah.See you guys.Okay.See you, Alan.So you still on 73rd Street? How do you know that? Getting back together as friends I like that.One more for the road? And, I mean, who knows? Maybe, when, like, you turn 40, if you haven't found anyone Oh, I already have that deal with Ted.Oh, right.Stupid.Well, maybe when you turn 39, if you haven't found anyone It turns out that they really did just need to let things run their course.So, uh, how's Barney doing? He's okay, I think.It might be a while before he fully recovers, but.Ooh! Did you guys just feel a chill? Yeah.Daddy's home.Well, Robin, I'm glad we could catch up.Oh, yeah, let's do it again soon.I love that you guys are still friends so long after you did that music video.Yeah.The music? Oh, the Sandcastles video, yes! Yes, we did that together, too.What do you mean too? Oh, we had this failed Canadian TV variety show we did.That was so embarrassing.Imagine what would happen if anybody ever got their hands on that? Oh, you.

979670^Reflections Upon The Distress And Agony Of Faith^https://images.genius.com/dae2bb5111d0259454133e19db273078.500x500x1.jpg^^If you respect yourself and worry about your soul you know youMust live a stricter and more retired life than even a virgin in aMaiden's bower. It is true that there are those who need to beForced and tamedand who would tumble about like wild beasts inLustful frenzy if they were left free. It is true and you can see itNow, quite close at your neighbour's house. But you have to showThat you are not one of that kind, by talking about it with anguishAnd fear. And talk you must with awe about the holy things, theGreat eternal truths, so that they won't be forgotten. If you can'tUnderstand their horrors, nor can you see their greatnessNow let's consider the distress and agony of the paradox of faith:The tragic hero acts to gain fame and glory for himself. The knightOf faith gives up his individuality to become the common manBecomeEveryman. It all depends on the will. If you think it'sEasy enough to be a single man, sufficient to yourself, you can beSure you are not a knight of faithWild birds and wandering geniuses are not the true knights. TheseKnow how blessed it is to belong to the commonThe true knight also knows how pleasant and wholesome it is to beAn individual who, so to speak, translates himself into a clean, neatAnd flawless edition , readable to each and everyone. He knows thatIt is refreshing to be understandable to everybody, as well as heAlso understands the common truths, and both of them rejoice inTheir shared confidence of the common. He rests assure that it'sPleasant to be born as a separate individual who is at home in theCommon, the kind and lasting place on Earth, which will receiveHim with open arms, when he finally wishes to rest there. But heAlso knows that far beyond this there is a lonely, narrow and steepPath, winding it's way through the wilderness. He knows what itWould be like to be born outside the common world and to have toTravel alone without meeting a single soul. He knows quite wellWhere he is and what his relation to other people is likeFrom a human point of view he is insane and can'tCommunicate with anybody. To put it mildly: he is as mad as aHatter. If he isn't regarded as such he is a hypocrite and the furtherHe travels along the way the worse hypocrisyThe knights of faith know how engulfing it is to give themselvesUp for the sake of the common. Courage is needed, but there isAlso a feeling of confidence since it is for common man. He knowsWhat a glorious thing it is to be understood by every truthful nobleMan, and by doing so be nobler in the mind himself. All this heKnows and feels as if committed to this faith. He would like toThink that this would be his mission of life...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

577232^East of Eden (Chapter 24)^https://images.genius.com/bdac2ac6a05d3dea1d3a0179344693e7.655x1000x1.jpg^1952-01-01^1I have wondered why it is that some people are less affected and torn by the verities of life and death than others. Una’s death cut the earth from under Samuel’s feet and opened his defended keep and let in old age. On the other hand Liza, who surely loved her family as deeply as did her husband, was not destroyed or warped. Her life continued evenly. She felt sorrow but she survived it.I think perhaps Liza accepted the world as she accepted the Bible, with all of its paradoxes and its reverses. She did not like death but she knew it existed, and when it came it did not surprise her.Samuel may have thought and played and philosophized about death, hut he did not really believe in it. His world did not have death as a member. He, and all around him, was immortal. When real death came it was an outrage, a denial of the immortality he deeply felt, and the one crack in his wall caused the whole structure to crash. I think he had always thought he could argue himself out of death. It was a personal opponent and one he could lick.To Liza it was simply death—the thing promised and expected. She could go on and in her sorrow put a pot of beans in the oven, bake six pies, and plan to exactness how much food would be necessary properly to feed the funeral guests. And she could in her sorrow see that Samuel had a clean white shirt and that his black broadcloth was brushed and free of spots and his shoes blacked. Perhaps it takes these two kinds to make a good marriage, riveted with several kinds of strengths.Once Samuel accepted, he could probably go farther than Liza, but the process of accepting tore him to pieces. Liza watched him closely after the decision to go to Salinas. She didn’t quite know what he was up to but, like a good and cautious mother, she knew he was up to something. She was a complete realist. Everything else being equal, she was glad to be going to visit her children. She was curious about them and their children. She had no love of places. A place was only a resting stage on the way to Heaven. She did not like work for itself, but she did it because it was there to be done. And she was tired. Increasingly it was more difficult to fight the aches and stiffnesses which tried to keep her in bed in the morning—not that they ever succeeded.And she looked forward to Heaven as a place where clothes did not get dirty and where food did not have to be cooked and dishes washed. Privately there were some things in Heaven of which she did not quite approve. There was too much singing, and she didn’t see how even the Elect could survive for very long the celestial laziness which was promised. She would find something to do in Heaven. There must be something to take up one’s time—some clouds to darn, some weary wings to rub with liniment. Maybe the collars of the robes needed turning now and then, and when you come right down to it, she couldn’t believe that even in Heaven there would not be cobwebs in some corner to be knocked down with a cloth-covered broom.She was gay and frightened about the visit to Salinas. She liked the idea so well that she felt there must be something bordering on sin involved in it. And the Chautauqua? Well, she didn’t have to go and probably wouldn’t. Samuel would run wild—she would have to watch him. She never lost her feeling that he was young and helpless. It was a good thing that she did not know what went on in his mind, and, through his mind, what happened to his body.Places were very important to Samuel. The ranch was a relative, and when he left it he plunged a knife into a darling. But having made up his mind, Samuel set about doing it well. He made formal calls on all of his neighbors, the old-timers who remembered how it used to be and how it was. And when he drove away from his old friends they knew they would not see him again, although he did not say it. He took to gazing at the mountains and the trees, even at faces, as though to memorize them for eternity.He saved his visit to the Trask place for last. He had not been there for months. Adam was not a young man any more. The boys were eleven years old, and Lee—well, Lee did not change much. Lee walked to the shed with Samuel.“I’ve wanted to talk to you for a long time,” said Lee. “But there’s so much to do. And I try to get to San Francisco at least once a month.”“You know how it is,” Samuel said. “When you know a friend is there you do not go to see him. Then he’s gone and you blast your conscience to shreds that you did not see him.”“I heard about your daughter. I’m sorry.”“I got your letter, Lee. I have it. You said good things.”“Chinese things,” said Lee. “I seem to get more Chinese as I get older.”“There’s something changed about you, Lee. What is it?”“It’s my queue, Mr. Hamilton. I’ve cut off my queue.”“That’s it.”“We all did. Haven’t you heard? The Dowager Empress is gone. China is free. The Manchus are not overlords and we do not wear queues. It was a proclamation of the new government. There’s not a queue left anywhere.”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lone wolf waits.TRAVIS watches the SLUM GODDESSES as they work the section of the street reserved for hippie hookers.TRAVIS' P.O.V.: some of the YOUNG STREET GIRLS are arrogant, almost aggressive, others are more insecure and inexperienced.A BLACK MAN charges down the sidewalk across the street from TRAVIS. He walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only at the sidewalk in front of him. Out of his mouth comes a continuous stream of invective: That-cock-sucking-crazy-no-good-asshole-bitch-when-I-get-my-fucking-fingers-on-her-nigger-tits-I'm-gonna-ring-em-and-shit-up-her-ass... and so on. He is Out of Control. Nobody seems to notice or care.TRAVIS takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake- out.Finally, TRAVIS spies the object of his search: IRIS walks down the sidewalk with her GIRLFRIEND. Iris wears her large blue sunglasses.TRAVIS checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), opens the door and exits from the cab.Flipping up the collar of his Army jacket, TRAVIS slouches over and walks toward IRIS. He sort of sidles up next to her and walks beside her: TRAVIS always looks most suspicious when he's trying to appear innocent.TRAVIS (shy): Hello.IRIS: You looking for some action?TRAVIS: Well...I guess so.IRIS (eyeing him): All right. (a beat) You see that guy over there? (nods) His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.Travis' eyes follow Iris' nod until they reach Sport, standing in a doorway in his lime green jacket. Travis walks toward him.Sport, a thirtiesh white greaser, has the affections of a black pimp. His hips are jiving, his fingers softly snapping. He sings to him self, Going to the chapel, gonna get married... His complexion is sallow; his eyes cold and venal. He could only seem romantic to a confused underaged runaway.TRAVIS: Your name Sport?Sport immediately takes Travis for an undercover cop. He extends his crosses wrists as if to be handcuffed.SPORT: Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all.

You know what? That new Cure album? It sucks. That new Happy Mondays album? I don't know if there is one, but, if there is, it sucksI can say this 'cause I know, 'cause I'm a Doors fanAnd, you know, if you wanna be a Doors fan, you know what? You might already be one and you don't even know it—you know, sort of like being gay. You're walkin' around, you know somethin's up, you just don't know what it is yetYou see, Doors fans aren't made, they're born. I bet right now, in Africa, there's some guy madly beatin' on a drum. He's one. Or an old lady on a bus, sucking humbugs. She's a rider on the storm and she don't even know it. I do, 'cause I'm a Doors fanAnd, if you wanna be a Doors fan, don't just go buy a greatest hits album either. Greatest hits albums are for housewives and little girls. If you want to be a Doors fan, you got to do it right. It's very scientific. You got to buy Waiting for the Sun. It's their third album, but, really, it's their first. We call it the departure pointOkay. Quick quiz: Who's playing bass? Hmm? No bass. That's right, the Doors had no bass. You see, the gypsies had no homes. Don't let that scare you, let that free you. Let that liberate you. 'Cause when you're free-flying with the Doors, man, you don't need no safety netIf you just scream Viva la Doors! loud enough for your landlord to start thumping on the wall, then you might, in fact, be a Doors fanThere's one way to know for absolute sure. Get an eight-track tape of L.A. Woman (there's only a few in existence) and steal a car. Even if you own one, steal a car. Get in that car; play the tape, full-blast; and drive West. When the tape ends, get out and go to the nearest bar and start to play pool or pinball or possibly even foosball and wait to get into a fight. Afterwards, get back in that car and drive it until it runs out of gas. Then, torch it. And, as you're standing there watching those flames, if you can still hear the Doors sound, then, my friend, you will have become a Doors fanYou wanna know how I know? You wanna know who told me? Well, last year, Jim fucking Morrison told me, that's who! He came to me. 'Cause I'm a Doors fan! I'm a Doors fan, man! Man. I love this sound. I like the Doors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” 8At once Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were discussing these questions among themselves; and he said to them, “Why do you raise such questions in your hearts? 9Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and take your mat and walk’? 10But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” —he said to the paralytic— 11“I say to you, stand up, take your mat and go to your home.” 12And he stood up, and immediately took the mat and went out before all of them; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”13Jesus went out again beside the sea; the whole crowd gathered around him, and he taught them. 14As he was walking along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him. 15And as he sat at dinner in Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were also sitting with Jesus and his disciples—for there were many who followed him. 16When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 17When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.”18Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and people came and said to him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?” 19Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 20The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.21“No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak; otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made. 22And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and so are the skins; but one puts new wine into fresh wineskins.”23One sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. 24The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?” 25And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food? 26He entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and he gave some to his companions.” 27Then he said to them, “The sabbath was made for humankind, and not humankind for the sabbath; 28so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

523349^Congregation Kadimah Toras-Moshe v. Deleo^https://images.genius.com/e4ad2904dd08a0c00b5f4576a3e3437d.500x500x1.jpg^1989-06-11^Citation:405 Mass. 365 (Mass. 1989)LIACOS, C.J.Congregation Kadimah Toras-Moshe (Congregation), an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, commenced this action in the Superior Court to compel the administrator of an estate (estate) to fulfil the oral promise of the decedent to give the Congregation $25,000. The Superior Court transferred the case to the Boston Municipal Court, which rendered summary judgement for the estate. The case was then transferred back to the Superior Court, which also rendered summary judgement for the estate and dismissed the Congregation's complaint. We granted the Congregation's application for direct appellate review. We now affirm.The facts are not contested. The decedent suffered a prolonged illness, throughout which he was visited by the Congregation's spiritual leader, Rabbi Abraham Halbfinger. During four or five of these visits, and in the presence of witnesses, the decedent made an oral promise to give the Congregation $25,000. The Congregation planned to use the $25,000 to transform a storage room in the synagogue into a library named after the decedent. The oral promise was never reduced to writing. The decedent died intestate in September, 1985. He had no children, but was survived by his wife.The Congregation asserts that the decedent's oral promise is an enforceable contract under our case law, because the promise is allegedly supported either by consideration and bargain, or by reliance. See Loranger Constr. Corp. v. E.F. Hauserman Co., 376 Mass. 757,761, 763 (1978) (distinguishing consideration and bargain from reliance in the absence of consideration). We disagree.The Superior Court judge determined that [t]his was an oral gratuitous pledge, with no indication as to how the money should be used, or what [the Congregation] was required to do if anything in return for this promise. There was no legal benefit to the promisor nor detriment to the promisee, and thus no consideration. See Marine Contractors Co. v. Hurley, 365 Mass. 280, 286 (1974); Gishen v. Dura Corp., 362 Mass. 177, 186 (1972) (moral obligation is not legal obligation). Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that the Congregation's plans to name a library after the decedent induced him to make or to renew his promise. Contrast Allegheny College v. National Chautauqua County Bank, 246 N.Y. 369, 377-379 (1927) (subscriber's promise became binding when charity implicitly promised to commemorate subscriber).As to the lack of reliance, the judge stated that the Congregation's allocation of $25,000 in its budget[,] for the purpose of renovating a storage room, is insufficient to find reliance or an enforceable obligation. We agree. The inclusion of the promised $25,000 in the budget, by itself, merely reduced to writing the Congregation's expectation that it would have additional funds. A hope or expectation, even though well founded, is not equivalent to either legal detriment or reliance.[2] Hall v. Horton House Microwave, Inc., 24 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 94 (1987).The Congregation cites several of our cases in which charitable subscriptions were enforced. These cases are distinguishable because they involved written, as distinguished from oral, promises and also involved substantial consideration or reliance. See, e.g., Trustees of Amherst Academy v. Cowls, 6 Pick. 427, 434 (1828) (subscribers to written agreement could not withdraw after the execution or during the progress of the work which they themselves set in motion); Trustees of Farmington Academy v. Allen, 14 Mass. 172, 176 (1817) (trustees justifiably proceed[ed] to incur expense, on the faith of the defendant's subscription). Conversely, in the case of Cottage St. Methodist Episcopal Church v. Kendall, 121 Mass. 528  (1877), we refused to enforce a promise in favour of a charity where there was no showing of any consideration or reliance.The Congregation asks us to abandon the requirement of consideration or reliance in the case of charitable subscriptions. The Congregation cites the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 90 (1981), which provides, in subsection (2): A charitable subscription ... is binding under Subsection (1) without proof that the promise induced action or forbearance. Subsection (1), as modified in pertinent part by subsection (2), provides: A promise which the promiser should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person ... is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise....Assuming without deciding that this court would apply § 90, we are of the opinion that in this case there is no injustice in declining to enforce the decedent's promise. Although § 90 dispenses with the absolute requirement of consideration or reliance, the official comments illustrate that these are relevant considerations. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, supra at § 90 comment f. The promise to the Congregation is entirely unsupported by consideration or reliance. Furthermore, it is an oral promise sought to be enforced against an estate. To enforce such a promise would be against public policy.Judgement affirmed.Footnotes:[1] Of the estate of Saul Schwam.[2] We do not use the expression `promissory estoppel, since it tends to confusion rather than clarify. Loranger Constr. Corp. v. E.F. Hauserman Co., 376 Mass. 757, 761 (1978).[3] The Congregation cites two cases for the proposition that Massachusetts requires so little consideration or reliance that, in practice, none is required. The Congregation misconstrues each case.The Congregation interprets this court's opinion in Robinson v. Nutt, 185 Mass. 345 (1904), to state the principle that the promises of several subscribers to donate funds are interdependent, that each promise is consideration or reliance for the other, and that each subscription is therefore an enforceable contract. This interpretation is neither the reasoning of the case nor good law in Massachusetts. The court in Robinson decided that the financial duties imposed on the charity therein, and adhered to by the charity for five years, were consideration for the promised funds. Id. at 348-349. The principle to which the Congregation refers, on the other hand, had been repudiated by this court in Cottage St. Methodist Episcopal Church v. Kendall, 121 Mass. 528, 530 (1877).The second case cited by the Congregation, In re Morton Shoe Co., 40 Bankr. 948 (D. Mass. 1984), is not controlling, and is in any event distinguishable. That case involved an organized campaign of solicitation and significant reliance by the charity therein. After the pledge drive, [the charity] establishe[d] an operating budget, determine[d] the amount of and recipients of distributions, and hire[d] personnel. In addition, based on the estimated amount of subscriptions, [the charity] borrow[ed] money from banks so that it [could] make immediate distributions to recipients before obtaining the actual pledge amount. Id. at 949. Thus, even assuming this case to have some precedential value, it demonstrates the need for reliance or consideration, not the opposite.[4] We need not decide whether we would enforce an oral promise where there was a showing of consideration or reliance.[5] The defendant argues that, if the decedent was aware of impending death, yet made no gift during life, then the promise is in the nature of a promise to make a will, which is unenforceable, by virtue of the Statute of Frauds. See G.L.c. 259, §§ 5, 5A (1986 ed.). Under the view we take, we need not consider this argument.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

702438^Julius Caesar^https://images.rapgenius.com/6966275b890a8cba58e750588e1b66c1.847x423x1.png^^What’s good yo? This week we cryin’ havoc with Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare.SummaryIn the 1st century BC, Julius Caesar and his army just cruised back to Rome after […] slapping his rival Pompey. And now he and his entourage raging through the streets to celebrate. It’s all poppin’ bottles […] ‘til some Soothsayer calls our boy out and say: “You best Beware the Ides of March, yo” -- but Caesar just shakes that hater off […]Later some busta named Cassius conversating with Brutus (Caesar’s main brutha from another motha). And Cassius be all like “Caesar gonna become king and he ain’t even all dat. Dat fool’s got to go. You feel me?” Brutus dig, but he ain’t happy ‘bout it. Caesar’s his boy, but he don’t want no tyrants messing with the Roman peeps. So he crew up with the cause and the sh-- goes DOWN March 15th.That day, Caesar bout to leave the crib when his biddy Calpurnia say: “baby don’t go. I seen some sh-- and just KNOW something whack gonna happen.” He like “oh sh--, word?” But when one of Cassius’ thugz roll up, he convinces Caesar […] “if you whipped like dat, you can stay home instead of letting us crown you King. Caesar be like “Hold up brotha. Don’t be like dat. Let’s do this.”As soon as they reach the spot, all them traitors whip out their blades and SHANK his a--. When Caesar sees his bro Brutus join in, he say “ Aw sh-- you too man?” Then BAM: dat fool dead. At Caesar’s funeral, Brutus try sweet-talkin the Romans by tellin em that killin Caesar was a FAVOR to Rome. And at first, erryone believe him.But Caesar’s boy Antony ain’t havin none of dat. He rocks the mic and makes all of Caesar’s killers look like real a--holes. Next thing you know, the Roman people be burning down houses and kick Brutus and Cassius to the [...] curb. So Antony, Octavius Caesar, and some rich playboy Lepidus start raisin a swole army to stomp dem backstabbin’ snitches.(snitches get stiches)Sh-- goes HAM at the battle of Philippi, where brothas screaming “187” on the reg. Then Cassius […] gets all torn-up and kills himself […] When Brutus’s army gets straight WRECKED, he decide he gonna stack one more body: his own. Then Antony roll up to Brutus’s body and pours one out for our boy, saying he was the most legit Roman of them all, cuz unlike the rest of dem backstabbin’ rats, Brutus was acting for the good of the hood.AnalysisNow if […] you reading straight history up in here, you best check yo-self. Cuz da bard wasn’t trippin’ bout historical accuracy, B. Matter of fact, some of the details he pulled right out of his a--. For example, in the play ol JC can’t hear sh-- out of one ear. And even though dat ain’t the way it was, Willy Shakes slangin’ dat detail to symbolize that although he can hear all the righteous things people say bout him, fool is COMPLETELY DEAF to all the warnings that his boys bout to cross him:I rather tell thee what is to be fear'dThan what I fear; for always I am Caesar.Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,And tell me truly what thou think'st of him (Act 1, Scene 2)And that’s part of what makes dis play a tragedy: Caesar’s head is so damn big that he thinking he should rock the crown even though it ain’t rightfully his. Caesar think he so hard dat ain’t nobody can touch him. So he don’t listen to nobody: his wife, da soothsayer... and dat’s why his arrogant a-- ends up in dirt. Cuz like Cicero say, people only hear what they wanna hear:Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time. / But men may construe things after their fashion / Clean from the purpose of the things themselvesAnd speakin’ of hearin’, listen up, son. Even though the play is called Julius Caesar, fool gets iced just half way through. Some scholas think that this play is really about Brutus and he the real tragic hero. Ain’t no doubt that he wanted to put his boy Caesar six feet deep. But unlike Cassius, who just a jealous playa-hater, Brutus was tryin to create a free Rome with no tyrants. So as much as it hurt Brutus to backstab his realest homie, that wasn’t his tragic flaw, his biggest mistake. Naw, blood. It was rollin with the wrong crew.So roll with the right crew and hit dat subscribe button!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

661634^Rap Genius Trends: 2014^https://images.rapgenius.com/b822eaf6be5675e1550b94a1b2d58a57.1000x667x1.png^2015-01-01^Listening to an album or single is one thing, spending the effort to search, and/or annotate an artists lyrics separates casual listeners from loyal fans. Genius analytics can truly determine who made the biggest impact in a calendar year. So with that in mind, we decided to breakdown lyric driven trends in 2014.Most viewed songs in 20142014 really felt like the year of the single. While we missed major label offerings from the game's hottest MC's, we had an abundance of outstanding singles, features and breakthrough artists. The likes of Bobby Shmurda, Rich Gang, and Rae Sremmurd dropped meme-generating songs quicker than you could understand what Young Thug was saying.  And although Thugger and Rae Sremmurd   may appear more times on the list, Bobby Shmurda took the crown with his single “Hot Nigga”, which  has snagged more than 3,0,000 page views since July last year.Even with the Young Thugs and Shmurdas in the rap game, fans found themselves furiously searching content from 2012 and 2013. Just under half the songs you'll find below were not from 2014. Most notably, 2013's two rap biggest songs - “Drunk In Love” & “Rap God” sit at the top of our view count. In an even bigger twist, Kendrick Lamar flexed his influence with “m.A.A.d city” - the 8th track from his modern classic good kid, m.A.A.d city broke into the top 10.1. Beyonce ft Jay Z - “Drunk In Love”2. Eminem - “Rap God”3. Bobby Shmurda - “Hot Nigga”4. Rich Gang - “Lifestyle”5. Beyonce - Partition6. Drake - “0-100/The Catch Up”7. Lil Wayne ft. Drake - “Believe Me”8. The Weeknd ft. Ty Dolla $ign & Wiz Khalifa- “Or Nah Remix”9. Kendrick Lamar ft. MC Eiht - “m.A.A.d city”10. Big Sean ft. E-40 - “I Don’t Fuck With You”11. T.I ft.Young Thug - “About The Money”12. Jhene Aiko - “The Worst”13. Rae Sremmurd - “No Flex Zone”14. Childish Gambino - “V. 3005”15. Nicki MInaj - “Lookin’ (Lookin' Ass Niggas”)16. Rae Sremmurd - No Type17. Eminem ft. Rihanna - “The Monster”18. Jay Z ft. Beyonce - “Part II: On The Run”19. Drake - Trophies20. Kanye West ft. Charlie Wilson - “Bound 2”Most viewed artists in 2014Song views may rule the roost when it comes to who had the hottest meme of the minute, but an artist is the total package. In 2014, only six of the most viewed artists on Genius released full albums. The most surprising addition to the top ten is Childish Gambino -  seeing his name there with raps heavyweights shows how far he's come from that infamous 1.6.Drake took 2014's crown as the most viewed artist on Genius - is this a surprise? Yes, for two reasons. The list doesn't include features, and Drake only released a handful of tracks in 2014, meaning he relied heavily on 2013's Nothing Was The Same. It looks like Yeezy was right all along, Drake really is the most popular man in rap.1. Drake2. Eminem3. Beyonce4. Kanye West5. Kendrick Lamar6. Childish Gambino7. Jay Z8. Lil Wayne9. J. Cole10. The Weeknd11. Nicki Minaj12. Rick Ross13. ScHoolboy Q14. Jhene Aiko15. Rich Gang16. Chief Keef17. Chris Brown18. Big Sean19. Chance The Rapper20. A$AP RockyBonus: The Carters Beyonce & Jay Z appear in the top ten artists, but only on records featuring each other in the most viewed songs list. This cements their power couple brand, but raises more questions about their individual status. Have the Beyonce & Jay Z brands been replaced by The Carters?What lyrics did you search for this year, surprised not to see something on the list?

506669^Oh Honey^https://images.genius.com/336826486ed36b87ca60d70ee088a945.230x316x1.jpg^^NARRATOR: Kids, after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to stay home a while to take care of his mother.(phone ringing) But the longer he stayed there, the more it was like he had never left Minnesota.Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.(laughs) Oh, that is too cute.Say it again.No.It's called manners, jerk.Now, what's-what's going on in New York? Give me something.There is one thing that's been going on.Uh, it's about Ted and Zoey.to save an old building from being torn down and replaced by a new building that I'd been hired to design.And yet somehow, despite this, we had all managed to become friends.Which brings us to the night Aunt Robin decided to cook dinner.I thought the oven was Celsius.It's okay.We got hot dogs.Yeah, and it's not like you can screw up a hot dog.Oh, God.This is so good.I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom.Could someone pass the ketchup? I hope I can pass this hot dog.Oh.(glass shatters) Oops.Well, looks like someone's going out in the cold to get more ketchup.Oh, come on, man, I brought the wine.Which is all gone.Oops.(sighs) All right, I tell you what-- you get this one bottle, I'll get the next three.Hmm, tell you what-- no dice.I'll get the next hundred.You're not getting out of this.You want to go on a date with my hot cousin? I'll get the ketchup.Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of Clue against myself, so make it good.Oh, it's good.You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while.Finally, Ted called her up.Hello.So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin.You still want to do that? Yes.And we miss you.But the cousin thing mostly.Let's get that going.Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.(Barney coughing) Cute means fat She's not fat.(coughing): Not fat means ugly Oh, here she is.(coughing): I take back everything I said.That girl is extremely attractive.Hey, Zoey.Hey.Ted, this is my cousin NARRATOR: Kids, to be honest, I don't quite remember this girl's name.None of us do, because as this story has been told and retold, we've always just referred to her as Honey.Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.And here's why.She is a lovely person-- warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible.It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, Oh, honey. Interesting.Show your work.My apartment building is so safe.My landlord-- he even installed a security camera in my shower.Oh, honey.Maybe I should feel weird about giving a stranger my Social Security number, but the guy's a Nigerian prince.Oh, honey.I just had a great TV audition.Behind the KFC where the executive producer works on the weekends.Oh, honey.Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost.Oh, honey.I know.You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea.She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves.Speaking of whom Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself.Oh, honey.ROBIN: So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey.Wow, an architect.How fascinating.Why do they call 'em coasters? And Barney.Okay, time to go home.Ted, a word.God, I hate these situations.What are we gonna do about this? What are you talking about? Come on, Ted, it's obvious.Honey's vibing on me.What? It's called body language.Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close? Mm-hmm.Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me.I mean that's as clear as a signal gets, so I'm so sorry, man.You're right.She's all yours, buddy.I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has.ROBIN: Good for you.Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys.Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.Hmm? He's gay! Mom, hang up! I'm sorry.(scoffs) Go on.Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.Hmm? I'm in love with Zoey.Oh, my God.Oh, my God! Mom! Sorry.Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married.That boy needs an intervention.Funny you should say that.Does anyone know why we're here? LILY: Yeah, who called this intervention? I did.It's for me.This is about the coffee breath.Finally.Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.BARNEY: Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch.It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop.And intervene.Are you sure it's love? (sighs) Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it.When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and (glass shatters) I knew, right in that moment, this isn't friendship.This is love.Wuss.Marcus! This is a private conversation! So what'd the wuss do next? This is love.And this was my grandmother's watch.Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me: I have to end my friendship with Zoey.Isn't that a little harsh? Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other.Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too.It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her.She'll always be around.Then what am I supposed to do? Okay, just shut it down.Okay, just ignore your feelings.If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self.Look, I like Zoey.Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success.So those feelings of yours-- shut 'em down.Fine.I'll shut 'em down.And seriously, mouthwash after coffee.(phone line beeps) Oh, um, that's my other line.It's not a number I recognize.So don't answer it.(line beeps) Yeah.(Minnesotan accent): Oh, my God, you are so Minnesota.You can't not answer the phone because it would be rude.(line beeps) Well, it would be.Good-bye.Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.Hey, Marshall.Barney.W- What number is this? I'm up on burners, playa.Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones.I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one.And then I'll do the same with my phone.Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story.I'll tell you that story.Hey, Zoey.Hey.Ted, this is my cousin Honey.MARSHALL: Uh Robin's version was That is exactly how it happened.So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her.Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect.Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits.Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Wow, an architect.How fascinating.Blah, blah, blah, blah.Rambling architecture anecdote.Blah, blah, something about a bridge.Blah, blah, blah (whispers): Straw.(whispers): Coaster.Okay, time to go home.Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.Who's your daddy? Okay, can we skip this part, please? Sure, I'll just summarize it.(imitating squeaky bedsprings) (squeaking accelerates) (squeaking slows) Okay, that's been going on a while.Only way I know how.Any-who, next day, I'm going into work.I run into Zoey.Hey, Zoey.That cousin of yours-- Honey-- yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts.Thanks.Yeah, we had a great time last night.And then just hand stuff in the morning, so Wait, she didn't go home with Ted? Nope, he let me have her.I have to say, it was pretty noble of him.He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine.I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize (imitating squeaky bedsprings) She hugged me.What was that all about? Zoey's in love with Ted.Marcus! Wait, hear me out, Marshall.Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married, so she tried to push him away by setting him up with her cousin instead.But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn.But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring.Wow.Zoey's in love with Ted.Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts.Would you like a Hertz Donut? Sure.Hey, where's the? No! Aah! Hurts, don't it? I can't believe you fell for that, bro.So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work.I got to call Ted.(phone ringing) Hello.Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey.Yeah, yeah.I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.Hey.I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd take you up on that beer you're about to offer me.Can I get you a beer? Oh, Ted, I'm so busy.But I guess I got time for one.Lead the way.(laughing): Oh, my God.What?! Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you? (laughs) What? Listen, Zoey, I, um I need to tell you something.Um Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's.You want anything? Mom! Get off the phone! Could you get some more Bugles, please? Of course, dear.Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up! And we need ice cream.Go on.I, uh I can't be friends with you anymore.And this may seem strange, but you can't ask me why.Wow.Okay.And that was it.No more Zoey.(line beeps) Oh.Hey, buddy, that's Lily.I should take that.But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted.Hey, baby.We hate Ted now.Get on board or the sexting stops.Ted's a son of a bitch! (cell phone chirps) Oh, nice.But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey.Oh, I know.But did he tell you the whole story? I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore.And you can't ask me why.Why? Lily hates you.You hate me? That's crazy.I don't hate you.Well, I know that's not true, Lily.Ted told me everything.He Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly? Lily hates you.She hates you so much it's hard to be around you.So we can't be friends.Oh, he Oh, yeah.Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore.I- I hate you.Bitch.I can't believe it.I really thought you and I were friends.Lord knows I could use a friend right now.I've been going through some pretty difficult stuff.Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff? I don't know.Well, you did the right thing, baby.Not entirely.Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because Robin hates you.(line beeps) And that's Robin on the other line.Oh, well, I'll let you take that.Love you, baby! Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.Listen, Robin.I know.I apologize for my wife.She never should have Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.Me? You dragged me into this?! You just went through a tragedy.It's not like she's gonna call you up and (line beeps) Oh, God, that's my other line.Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey! Just don't answer it.I can't not answer.It's impolite.Marshall, you can beat this.I can't turn my back on politeness.You don't have to answer.You can just let it ring.Good manners are what separate us from those elbows on the table Wisconsinites.You can do this.I believe in you.Don't do it, Marshall! I'm sorry, Robin! Eriksen residence.Marshall speaking.Hi.I spent the night with your friend Barney and he accidentally left his phone in my apartment, in the garbage.But I've been going through all of his contacts because I'm sure he wants to get in touch with me.After all, he told me, uh I was his first.Oh, honey.Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin.Hi.Listen, um, about Barney Oh, yeah.He's such a sweet guy.Who's your daddy? (giggles): Oh Who's your daddy? (sobbing): I don't know.I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad.His mom gave him the guy's address.So I wrote him a letter.And I poured my heart out.And I gave him my number and I told him to call me.And he still hasn't called me.Oh, honey.I mean, I shouldn't be surprised.Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.Oh, honey.I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you.He's ashamed of himself.I mean, look at you.You're do so great without him.I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.Four.Four Nobel Prizes.Four.See? That is impressive.I mean, how many does he have? Only three.Well, there you go.Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through? Oh, I can't tell you about that.The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist.I am her therapist.Oh! Well, in that case Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today.I got to go.Bye.Mom! Marcus! (knocking at door) What's this really about? I told you.Lily hates you.I think you hate me.I think you have some big problem with me, and you're too chicken to come out and say it.All right.Yes.I hate you.Great.See? Was that so hard? Zoey.Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought (sighs) I just want to know why.So we got Ted and Zoey.Ted is in love with Zoey.Zoey has no idea.Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it.Which tells us what? Zoey's in love with Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know.So Ted and Zoey-- they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard.I mean, The Captain.Except now, as Honey informs me And we miss you.But the cousin thing mostly.Let's get that going.Fine, I will, uh, make it happen.Good-bye.Okay.Well I guess I'll take it.Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced.Which means?

From behind his leg Vardaman peers, with his round head and his eyes round and his mouth beginning to open. She looks at pa; all her failing life appears to drain into her eyes, urgent, irremediable. It's Jewel she wants, Dewey Dell says.Why, Addle, pa says, him and Darl went to make one more load. They thought there was time. That you would wait for them, and that three dollars and all. . . . He stoops laying his hand on hers. For a while yet she looks at him, without reproach, without anything at all, as if her eyes alone are listening to the irrevocable cessation of his voice. Then she raises herself, who has not moved in ten days. Dewey Dell leans down, trying to press her back.Ma, she says; ma.She is looking out the window, at Cash stooping steadily at the board in the failing light, laboring on toward darkness and into it as though the stroking of the saw illumined its own motion, board and saw engendered.You, Cash, she shouts, her voice harsh, strong, and unimpaired. You, Cash!He looks up at the gaunt face framed by the window in the twilight. It is a composite picture of all time since he was a child. He drops the saw and lifts the board for her to see, watching the window in which the face has not moved. He drags a second plank into position and slants the two of them into their final juxtaposition, gesturing toward the ones yet on the ground, shaping with his empty hand in pantomime the finished box. For a while still she looks down at him from the composite picture, neither with censure nor approbation. Then the face disappears.She lies back and turns her head without so much as glancing at pa. She looks at Vardaman; her eyes, the life in them, rushing suddenly upon them; the two flames glare up for a steady instant. Then they go out as though someone had leaned down and blown upon them.Ma, Dewey Dell says; ma! Leaning above the bed, her hands lifted a little, the fan still moving like it has for ten days, she begins to keen. Her voice is strong, young, tremulous and clear, rapt with its own timbre and volume, the fan still moving steadily up and down, whispering the useless air. Then she flings herself across Addle Bundren's knees, clutching her, shaking her with the furious strength of the young before sprawling suddenly across the handful of rotten bones that Addie Bundren left, jarring the whole bed into a chattering sibilance of mattress shucks, her arms outflung and the fan in one hand still beating with expiring breath into the quilt.From behind pa's leg Vardaman peers, his mouth full open and all color draining from his face into his mouth, as though he has by some means fleshed his own teeth in himself, sucking. He begins to move slowly backward from the bed, his eyes round, his pale face fading into the dusk like a piece of paper pasted on a failing wall, and so out of the door.Pa leans above the bed in the twilight, his humped silhouette partaking of that owl-like quality of awry-feathered, disgruntled outrage within which lurks a wisdom too profound or too inert for even thought.Durn them boys, he says.Jewel, I say. Overhead the day drives level and gray, hiding the sun by a flight of gray spears. In the rain the mules smoke a little, splashed yellow with mud, the off one clinging in sliding lunges to the side of the road above the ditch. The tilted lumber gleams dull yellow, water-soaked and heavy as lead, tilted at a steep angle into the ditch above the broken wheel; about the shattered spokes and about Jewel's, ankles a runnel of yellow neither water nor earth swirls, curving with the yellow road neither of earth nor water, down the hill dissolving into a streaming mass of dark green neither of earth nor sky.Jewel, I sayCash comes to the door, carrying the saw. Pa stands beside the bed, humped, his arms dangling. He turns his head, his shabby profile, his chin collapsing slowly as he works the snuff against his gums.She's gone, Cash says.She taken and left us, pa says. Cash does not look at him. How nigh are you done? pa says. Cash does not answer. He enters, carrying the saw. I reckon you better get at it, pa says. You'll have to do the best you can, with them boys gone off that-a-way. Cash looks down at her face. He is not listening to pa at all. He does not approach the bed. He stops in the middle of the floor, the saw against his leg, his sweating arms powdered lightly with sawdust, his face composed. If you get in a tight, maybe some of themll get here tomorrow and help you, pa says. Vernon could. Cash is not listening. He is looking down at her peaceful, rigid face fading into the dusk as though darkness were a precursor of the ultimate earth, until at last the face seems to float detached upon it, lightly as the reflection of a dead leaf. There is Christians enough to help you, pa says. Cash is not listening. After a while he turns without looking at pa and leaves the room. Then the saw begins to snore again. They will help us in our sorrow, pa says.The sound of the saw is steady, competent, unhurried, stirring the dying light so that at each stroke her face seems to wake a little into an expression of listening and of waiting, as though she were counting the strokes. Pa looks down at the face, at the black sprawl of Dewey Dell's hair, the outflung arms, the clutched fan now motionless on the fading quilt. I reckon you better get supper on, he says.Dewey Dell does not move.Git up, now, and put supper on, pa says. We got to keep our strength up. I reckon Doctor Pea-body's right hungry, coming all this way. And Cash'll need to eat quick and get back to work so he can finish it in time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

517305^Gods and Fighting Men - Part II - Book I Chapter 4: Oisin’s Mother^https://images.genius.com/eac67c4216bc04d3117cccd70c31d566.214x320x1.jpg^^Part IIBook IChapter 4: Oisin's MotherIT happened one time Finn and his men were coming back from the hunting, a beautiful fawn started up before them, and they followed after it, men and dogs, till at last they were all tired and fell back, all but Finn himself and Bran and Sceolan. And suddenly as they were going through a valley, the fawn stopped and lay down on the smooth grass, and Bran and Sceolan came up with it, and they did not harm it at all, but went playing about it, licking its neck and its face.There was wonder on Finn when he saw that, and he went on home to Almhuin, and the fawn followed after him playing with the hounds, and it came with them into the house at Almhuin. And when Finn was alone late that evening, a beautiful young woman having a rich dress came before him, and she told him it was she herself was the fawn he was after hunting that day. And it is for refusing the love of Fear Doirche, the Dark Druid of the Men of Dea, she said, I was put in this shape. And through the length of three years, she said, I have lived the life of a wild deer in a far part of Ireland, and I am hunted like a wild deer. And a serving-man of the Dark Druid took pity on me, she said, and he said that if I was once within the dun of the Fianna of Ireland, the Druid would have no more power over me. So I made away, and I never stopped through the whole length of a day till I came into the district of Almhuin. And I never stopped then till there was no one after me but only Bran and Sceolan, that have human wits; and I was safe with them, for they knew my nature to be like their own.Then Finn gave her his love, and took her as his wife, and she stopped in Almhuin. And so great was his love for her, he gave up his hunting and all the things he used to take pleasure in, and gave his mind to no other thing but herself.But at last the men of Lochlann came against Ireland, and their ships were in the bay below Beinn Edair, and they landed there.And Finn and the battalions of the Fianna went out against them, and drove them back. And at the end of seven days Finn came back home, and he went quickly over the plain of Almhuin, thinking to see Sadbh his wife looking out from the dun, but there was no sign of her. And when he came to the dun, all his people came out to meet him, but they had a very downcast look. Where is the flower of Almhuin, beautiful gentle Sadbh? he asked them. And it is what they said: While you were away fighting, your likeness, and the likeness of Bran and of Sceolan appeared before the dun, and we thought we heard the sweet call of the Dord Fiann. And Sadbh, that was so good and so beautiful, came out of the house, they said, and she went out of the gates, and she would not listen to us, and we could not stop her. Let me go meet my love, she said, my husband, the father of the child that is not born. And with that she went running out towards the shadow of yourself that was before her, and that had its arms stretched out to her. But no sooner did she touch it than she gave a great cry, and the shadow lifted up a hazel rod, and on the moment it was a fawn was standing on the grass. Three times she turned and made for the gate of the dun, but the two hounds the shadow had with him went after her and took her by the throat and dragged her back to him. And by your hand of valour, Finn, they said, we ourselves made no delay till we went out on the plain after her. But it is our grief, they had all vanished, and there was not to be seen woman, or fawn or Druid, but we could hear the quick tread of feet on the hard plain, and the howling of dogs. And if you would ask every one of us in what quarter he heard those sounds, he would tell you a different one.When Finn heard that, he said no word at all, but he struck his breast over and over again with his shut hands. And he went then to his own inside room, and his people saw him no more for that day, or till the sun rose over Magh Lifé on the morrow.And through the length of seven years from that time, whenever he was not out fighting against the enemies of Ireland, he went searching and ever searching in every far corner for beautiful Sadbh. And there was great trouble on him all the time, unless be might throw it off for a while in hunting or in battle. And through all that time he never brought out to any hunting but the five hounds he had most trust in, Bran and Sceolan and Lomaire and Bred and Lomluath, the way there would be no danger for Sadbh if ever he came on her track.But after the end of seven years, Finn and some of his chief men were hunting on the sides of Beinn Gulbain, and they heard a great outcry among the hounds, that were gone into some narrow place. And when they followed them there, they saw the five hounds of Finn in a ring, and they keeping back the other hounds, and in the middle of the ring was a young boy, with high looks, and he naked and having long hair. And be was no way daunted by the noise of the hounds, and did not look at them at all, but at the men that were coming up. And as soon as the fight was stopped Bran and Sceolan went up to the little lad, and whined and licked him, that any one would think they had forgotten their master. Finn and the others came up to him then, and put their hands on his head, and made much of him. And they brought him to their own hunting cabin, and he ate and drank with them, and before long he lost his wildness and was the same as themselves. And as to Bran and Sceolan, they were never tired playing about him.And it is what Finn thought, there was some look of Sadbh in his face, and that it might be he was her son, and he kept him always beside him. And little by little when the boy had learned their talk, he told them all he could remember. He used to be with a deer he loved very much, he said, and that cared and sheltered him, and it was in a wide place they used to be, having hills and valleys and streams and woods in it, but that was shut in with high cliffs on every side, that there was no way of escape from it. And he used to be eating fruits and roots in the summer, and in the winter there was food left for him in the shelter of a cave. And a dark-looking man used to be coming to the place, and sometimes he would speak to the deer softly and gently, and sometimes with a loud angry voice. But whatever way he spoke, she would always draw away from him with the appearance of great dread on her, and the man would go away in great anger. And the last time he saw the deer, his mother, the dark man was speaking to her for a long time, from softness to anger. And at the end he struck her with a hazel rod, and with that she was forced to follow him, and she looking back all the while at the child, and crying after him that any one would pity her. And he tried hard to follow after her, and made every attempt, and cried with grief and rage, but he had no power to move, and when he could hear his mother no more he fell on the grass and his wits went from him. And when he awoke it is on the side of the hill he was, where the hounds found him. And he searched a long time for the place where he was brought up, but he could not find it.And the name the Fianna gave him was Oisin, and it is he was their maker of poems, and their good fighter afterwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reasons why our Mediator behoved to be very God, and to become man, sec. 1-3. II. Disposal of various objections by some fanatics, and especially by Osiander, to the orthodox doctrine concerning the Mediator, sec. 4-7.Sections.1. Necessary, not absolutely, but by divine decree, that the Mediator should be God, and become man. Neither man nor angel, though pure, could have sufficed. The Son of God behoved to come down. Man in innocence could not penetrate to God without a Mediator, much less could he after the fall.2. A second reason why the Mediator behoved to be God and man--viz.  that he had to convert those who were heirs of hell into children of God.3. Third reason, that in our flesh he might yield a perfect obedience, satisfy the divine justice, and pay the penalty of sin. Fourth reason, regarding the consolation and confirmation of the whole Church.4. First objection against the orthodox doctrine: Answer to it.  Conformation from the sacrifices of the Law, the testimony of the Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, and even Christ himself.5. Second objection: Answer: Answer confirmed. Third objection: Answer.  Fourth objection by Osiander: Answer.6. Fifth objection, forming the basis of Osiander's errors on this subject: Answer. Nature of the divine image in Adam. Christ the head of angels and men.7. Sixth objection: Answer. Seventh objection: Answer. Eighth objection: Answer. Ninth objection: Answer. Tenth objection: Answer.  Eleventh objection: Answer. Twelfth objection: Answer. The sum of the doctrine.1. It deeply concerned us, that he who was to be our Mediator should be very God and very man. If the necessity be inquired into, it was not what is commonly termed simple or absolute, but flowed from the divine decree on which the salvation of man depended. What was best for us, our most merciful Father determined. Our iniquities, like a cloud intervening between Him and us, having utterly alienated us from the kingdom of heaven, none but a person reaching to him could be the medium of restoring peace. But who could thus reach to him? Could any of the sons of Adam? All of them, with their parents, shuddered at the sight of God. Could any of the angels? They had need of a head, by connection with which they might adhere to their God entirely and inseparably. What then? The case was certainly desperate, if the Godhead itself did not descend to us, it being impossible for us to ascend. Thus the Son of God behoved to become our Emmanuel, the God with us; and in such a way, that by mutual union his divinity and our nature might be combined; otherwise, neither was the proximity near enough, nor the affinity strong enough, to give us hope that God would dwell with us; so great was the repugnance between our pollution and the spotless purity of God. Had man remained free from all taint, he was of too humble a condition to penetrate to God without a Mediator.  What, then, must it have been, when by fatal ruin he was plunged into death and hell, defiled by so many stains, made loathsome by corruption; in fine, overwhelmed with every curse? It is not without cause, therefore, that Paul, when he would set forth Christ as the Mediator, distinctly declares him to be man. There is, says he, one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, (1 Tim. 2:5). He might have called him God, or at least, omitting to call him God he might also have omitted to call him man; but because the Spirit, speaking by his mouth, knew our infirmity, he opportunely provides for it by the most appropriate remedy, setting the Son of God familiarly before us as one of ourselves. That no one, therefore, may feel perplexed where to seek the Mediator, or by what means to reach him, the Spirit, by calling him man, reminds us that he is near, nay, contiguous to us, inasmuch as he is our flesh. And, indeed, he intimates the same thing in another place, where he explains at greater length that he is not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, (Heb. 4:15).2. This will become still clearer if we reflect, that the work to be performed by the Mediator was of no common description: being to restore us to the divine favour, so as to make us, instead of sons of men, sons of God; instead of heirs of hell, heirs of a heavenly kingdom. Who could do this unless the Son of God should also become the Son of man, and so receive what is ours as to transfer to us what is his, making that which is his by nature to become ours by grace?  Relying on this earnest, we trust that we are the sons of God, because the natural Son of God assumed to himself a body of our body, flesh of our flesh, bones of our bones, that he might be one with us; he declined not to take what was peculiar to us, that he might in his turn extend to us what was peculiarly his own, and thus might be in common with us both Son of God and Son of man. Hence that holy brotherhood which he commends with his own lips, when he says, I ascend to my Father, and your Father, to my God, and your God, (John 20:17). In this way, we have a sure inheritance in the heavenly kingdom, because the only Son of God, to whom it entirely belonged, has adopted us as his brethren; and if brethren, then partners with him in the inheritance (Rom. 8:17). Moreover, it was especially necessary for this cause also that he who was to be our Redeemer should be truly God and man. It was his to swallow up death: who but Life could do so? It was his to conquer sin: who could do so save Righteousness itself? It was his to put to flight the powers of the air and the world: who could do so but the mighty power superior to both? But who possesses life and righteousness, and the dominion and government of heaven, but God alone? Therefore, God, in his infinite mercy, having determined to redeem us, became himself our Redeemer in the person of his only begotten Son.3. Another principal part of our reconciliation with God was, that man, who had lost himself by his disobedience, should, by way of remedy, oppose to it obedience, satisfy the justice of God, and pay the penalty of sin. Therefore, our Lord came forth very man, adopted the person of Adam, and assumed his name, that he might in his stead obey the Father; that he might present our flesh as the price of satisfaction to the just judgment of God, and in the same flesh pay the penalty which we had incurred. Finally, since as God only he could not suffer, and as man only could not overcome death, he united the human nature with the divine, that he might subject the weakness of the one to death as an expiation of sin, and by the power of the other, maintaining a struggle with death, might gain us the victory. Those, therefore, who rob Christ of divinity or humanity either detract from his majesty and glory, or obscure his goodness. On the other hand, they are no less injurious to men, undermining and subverting their faith, which, unless it rest on this foundation, cannot stand. Moreover, the expected Redeemer was that son of Abraham and David whom God had promised in the Law and in the Prophets. Here believers have another advantage. Tracing up his origin in regular series to David and Abraham, they more distinctly recognise him as the Messiah celebrated by so many oracles. But special attention must be paid to what I lately explained, namely, that a common nature is the pledge of our union with the Son of God; that, clothed with our flesh, he warred to death with sin that he might be our triumphant conqueror; that the flesh which he received of us he offered in sacrifice, in order that by making expiation he might wipe away our guilt, and appease the just anger of his Father.4. He who considers these things with due attention, will easily disregard vague speculations, which attract giddy minds and lovers of novelty. One speculation of this class is, that Christ, even though there had been no need of his interposition to redeem the human race, would still have become man. I admit that in the first ordering of creation, while the state of nature was entire, he was appointed head of angels and men; for which reason Paul designates him the first-born of every creature, (Col. 1:15). But since the whole Scripture proclaims that he was clothed with flesh in order to become a Redeemer, it is presumptuous to imagine any other cause or end. We know well why Christ was at first promised--viz. that he might renew a fallen world, and succour lost man. Hence under the Law he was typified by sacrifices, to inspire believers with the hope that God would be propitious to them after he was reconciled by the expiation of their sins. Since from the earliest age, even before the Law was promulgated, there was never any promise of a Mediator without blood, we justly infer that he was destined in the eternal counsel of God to purge the pollution of man, the shedding of blood being the symbol of expiation.  Thus, too, the prophets, in discoursing of him, foretold that he would be the Mediator between God and man. It is sufficient to refer to the very remarkable prophecy of Isaiah (Is. 53:4, 5), in which he foretells that he was smitten for our iniquities; that the chastisement of our peace was upon him; that as a priest he was made an offering for sin; that by his stripes we are healed; that as all like lost sheep have gone astray, it pleased the Lord to bruise him, and put him to grief, that he might bear our iniquities. After hearing that Christ was divinely appointed to bring relief to miserable sinners, whose overleaps these limits gives too much indulgence to a foolish curiosity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

754064^Last Requiem For The Storm^https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1668632954^^Descend into the abysmal depths; Wasting away in the trenches of existence. A cold darkness has fallen; The agony's welled up inside; The dams of vigor are breaking the; Torrent of anguish will no longer subside. Whilst night falls so comes the tide. As the rushing waves of pain crash; And the swirling waters of depression engulf you; As you lay gasping for air the illness festers within; Until surrender is the only option. Forever sorrow comes tonight as you decide to end your life. We shall meet again one day; at the two points of the circle; Where birth and death; are one and the same. As this world could not appease; Your desires or quell your miseries; You must venture out past its bounds; So take one last breath as you drown. This end shalt cause more suffering; But such is our task; We must persevere to traverse these dark waters; Lest we forget the tragedy. Time must heal all wounds; Time could not heal your wounds. A weakened soul incarcerated from within; A living hell that none should have to endure; In a world full of wondrous questions we ask why; At the end of this journey may we finally know. Words will never be able to convey; The emotions your actions have borne in me. For every tomorrow brings a new day of sorrow. Our mourning and bereavement; Succumbs to the dusk of acceptance. Days will pass on and so must we too; All sacrifice and all suffering is redemptive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

529013^Gadsby Chapter 11^https://images.genius.com/9271d647e10a0504ce3511d8c26aece5.600x911x1.jpg^^BUT TO GO BACK TO Nancy. It was in August that Frank had stumblingly told Gadsby of his troth; and so, along in April, Branton Hills was told that a grand church ritual would occur in May. May, with its blossoms, birds and balmy air! An idyllic month for matrimony. I wish that I could call this grand church affair by its common, customary nomination; but that word can’t possibly crowd into this story. It must pass simply as a church ritual.All right; so far, so good. So, along into April all Branton Hills was agog, awaiting information as to that actual day; or, I should say, night.Gadsby’s old Organization of Youth was still as loyal to all in it as it was, way back in days of its formation; days of almost constantly running around town, soliciting funds for many a good Municipal activity. Finally this group got cards announcing that on May Fourth, Branton Hills’ First Church would admit all who might wish to aid in starting Nancy and Frank upon that glamorous path to matrimonial bliss.May Fourth was punctual in arriving; though many a young girl got into that flighty condition in which a month drags along as though in irons, and clock-hands look as if stuck fast. But to many girls, also, May Fourth was not any too far away; for charming gowns and dainty hats do not grow upon shrubs, you know; and girls who work all day must hurry at night, at manipulating a thousand or so things which go towards adorning our girls of today.Now, an approach to a young girl’s “big day” is not always as that girl might wish. Small things bob up, which, at first, look actually disastrous for a joyous occasion; and for Nancy and Frank, just such a thing did bob up; for, on May Third, a pouring rain and whistling wind put Branton Hills’ spirits way, way down into a sorrowful slump. Black, ugly, rumbling clouds hung aggravatingly about in a saturation of mist, rain and fog; and roads and lawns got such a washing that Nancy said:— “Anyway, if I can’t walk across that front church yard, I can swim it!!”That was Nancy; a small bunch of inborn good humor; and I’ll say, right now, that it took good humor, and lots of it, to look upon conditions out of your control, with such outstanding pluck!But young Dan Cupid was still around, and got in touch with that tyrannical mythological god who controls storms; and put forth such a convincing account of all Nancy’s good points, (and Frank’s too, if anybody should ask you) that a command rang out across a stormy sky:— “Calling all clouds!! Calling all clouds!!All rain to stop at midnight of May Third! Bright Sun on May Fourth, and no wind!So, as Nancy took an anxious squint out of doors at about six o’clock on that important morning, (and what young girl could go on, calmly snoozing on such a day?) Lo!! Old Sol was smiling brightly down on Branton Hills; birds sang; all sorts of blossoming things had had a good drink; and a most glorious sky, rid of all ugly clouds, put our young lady into such a happy mood that it took a lot of control to avoid just a tiny bit of humidity around a small pair of rich, brown orbs which always had that vibrating, dancing light of happy youth; that miraculous “joy of living.”And, what a circus was soon going full tilt in Mayor Gadsby’s mansion! If that happy man so much as said:-“Now, I—” a grand, womanly chorus told him that “a man don’t know anything about such affairs;” and that a most satisfactory spot for him was in a hammock on his porch, with a good cigar! That’s it! A man is nominally monarch in his own family; but only so on that outstanding day upon which a bridal gown is laid out in all its glory on his parlor sofa, and a small mob of girls, and occasionally a woman or two, is rushing in and out, up and down stairs, and finding as much to do as a commonly known microscopic “bug” of prodigious hopping ability finds at a dog show. Rush! rush! rush! A thousand thoughts and a million words, (this crowd was all girls, you know!) making that parlor as noisy as a saw mill! But Gadsby laughingly staid out of it all, watching big armfuls of bloom and many a curious looking box go in through that front door; flying hands rapidly untying glorious ribbon wrappings.Now, upon all such occasions you will find, if you snoop around in dining room or pantry, an astonishing loaf of culinary art, all fancy frosting, and chuck full of raisins and citron, which is always cut upon such an auspicious occasion; and it is as hard to avoid naming it, in this story, as it is to withstand its assault upon your stomach.Oh hum! Now what? Aha! May Fourth, lasting, as Nancy said, “for about a million months,” finally got Gadsby’s dining room clock around to six-fifty; only about an hour, now, to that grand march past practically half of Branton Hills’ population; for all who couldn’t jam into that commodious church would stand around in a solid phalanx, blocking all traffic in that part of town; for all Branton Hills was fond of its Mayor’s “baby girl.”But, during this rush and hubbub, how about Frank? Poor boy! Now, if you think that a young lad at such an instant is as calm as a millpond, you don’t know romantic Youth, that’s all. About forty of Gadsby’s old Organization boys, now many young chaps, had bought him a car, which Nancy was not to know anything about until that throwing of old boots, and what is also customary, had quit. Frank didn’t want to hold it back from Nancy, but what can a chap do, against forty? Also, last night, at a big “so sorry, old chap” party, Frank had found how loyal a bunch of old pals can turn out; and this “grand launching into matrimonial doubt” had put him in a happy mood for that all important oration of two words :—“I do.”So now I’ll hurry around to church to find out how Nancy’s Organization girls put in a long day of hard labor; not only at floor work, but up on stools and chairs. My! My! Just look and gasp!! A long chain of lilacs runs from door to altar in two rows. And look at that big arch of wistaria and narcissus half way along! Artificial palms stand in curving ranks from organ to walls; and, with all lights softly glowing through pink silk hoods; and with gilt cords outlining an altar-dais of moss and sprays of asparagus, it is a sight to bring a thrill to anybody, young or old.And, now — aha!! With organist and Pastor waiting, a murmur and hand-clapping from that big front door told all who had luckily got in that Nancy was coming! It took thirty cars to bring that bridal party to church; for not a boy or girl of our old Organization would miss this occasion for a farm, with a pig on it with four kinks in its tail. Now, naturally, any girl would long to walk up that Holy path with Nancy, but too many would spoil things; so, by drawing lots, Nancy had for company, Sarah Young, Lucy Donaldson, Priscilla Standish, Virginia Adams, Doris Johnson and Cora Grant; with Kathlyn as Maid of Honor, as charming an array of youthful glory as you could find in all Branton Hills.Until this important arrival, Branton Hills’ famous organist, just plain John Smith, was playing softly, - “Just a Song at Twilight,” watching for a signal from Mayor Gadsby; and soon swung into that famous march which brought forth a grand thrill, as tiny, blushing, palpitating Nancy took “Dad’s” arm, gazing with shining orbs at that distant—oh, so distant—altar.Now I want to know why anybody should want to cry on such a grand occasion. What is sad about it? But many a lash was moist as that tiny vision of glamorous purity slowly trod that fragrant pathway. Possibly girls can’t avoid it; anyway, our Branton Hills girls didn’t try to do so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

528960^Typical Soldiers^https://images.genius.com/896faf28d1d41c0758e5e0ff4a56afcd.1000x801x1.jpg^^    Even the typical soldiers I have been personally intimate with,—it seems to me if I were to make a list of them it would be like a city directory. Some few only have I mention'd in the foregoing pages—most are dead—a few yet living. There is Reuben Farwell, of Michigan, (little Mitch;) Benton H. Wilson, color-bearer, 185th New York; Wm. Stansberry; Manvill Winterstein, Ohio; Bethuel Smith; Capt. Simms, of 51st New York, (kill'd at Petersburgh mine explosion,) Capt. Sam. Pooley and Lieut. Fred. McReady, same reg't. Also, same reg't., my brother, George W. Whitman—in active service all through, four years, re-enlisting twice—was promoted, step by step, (several times immediately after battles,) lieutenant, captain, major and lieut. colonel—was in the actions at Roanoke, Newbern, 2d Bull Run, Chantilly, South Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburgh, Vicksburgh, Jackson, the bloody conflicts of the Wilderness, and at Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor, and afterwards around Petersburgh; at one of these latter was taken prisoner, and pass'd four or five months in secesh military prisons, narrowly escaping with life, from a severe fever, from starvation and half-nakedness in the winter. (What a history that 51st New York had! Went out early—march'd, fought everywhere—was in storms at sea, nearly wreck'd—storm'd forts—tramp'd hither and yon in Virginia, night and day, summer of '62—afterwards Kentucky and Mississippi—re-enlisted—was in all the engagements and campaigns, as above.) I strengthen and comfort myself much with the certainty that the capacity for just such regiments, (hundreds, thousands of them) is inexhaustible in the United States, and that there isn't a county nor a township in the republic—nor a street in any city—but could turn out, and, on occasion, would turn out, lots of just such typical soldiers, whenever wanted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

521079^Ending a Sentence with a Preposition^https://images.genius.com/6fa3a1ec94553917f463b6f6a13b3ac2.400x400x1.jpg^2011-02-23^Welcome to Ask the Editor. I'm Emily Brewster, an Associate Editor at Merriam-Webster.To some of you, what I'm about to say will be a huge relief, and to others—a complete abomination. Here it goes: A preposition is a perfectly appropriate kind of word to end a sentence with. So where did the rule telling us it's not okay to end a sentence with a preposition come from?Well, it seems that the 17th-century English poet, playwright and essayist John Dryden is to blame. In a 1672 essay, Dryden castigated the writers of the generation preceding him, a generation that included Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, for a variety of things—among them ending sentences with prepositions.Dryden most likely objected to the terminal preposition because Latin doesn't allow the construction, and it was fashionable at the time to assert that English should be more like Latin. Whatever the rationale behind it, Dryden's objection got passed down as grammar law and written into the books used to teach grammar in schools.But really,—you might ask—wasn't Dryden on to something? Don't sentences ending in prepositions sound sloppier than those that don't? Well, maybe in some cases, although that may be because we've been conditioned to think so. The fact is, we've been using the terminal preposition since the days of Old English. And in some instances, avoiding the terminal preposition makes things plain weird. Do we really want to change a sentence like Give them what they asked for to Give them the thing for which they asked?So I say, when it feels natural to end a sentence in a preposition, do so. And if someone gives you a hard time about it, feel free to respond to the criticism as Winston Churchill according to unconfirmed legend did, his tongue firmly in cheek: This is just the sort of nonsense up with which I will not put.Tune in again soon for future installments of Ask the Editor here at merriam-webster.com.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I memorize it. I mean, my mouth is moving but I don't understand what I'm sayingIt's like sitting at the breakfast table and it's early in the morning and you're not quite awake. And you're just sitting there eating cereal and sort of staring at the writing on the box--not reading it exactly, just more or less looking at the words. And suddenly, for some reason, you snap to attention, and you realize that what you're reading is what you're eating ... but by then it's much too lateAfter doing these concerts in French, I usually had the temporary illusion that I could actually speak French, but as soon as I walked out on the street, and someone asked me simple directions, I realized I couldn't speak a single word. As a result of this inadequacy, I found that the people I had the most rapport with were the babies. And one of the things I noticed about these babies was that they were apparently being used as some kind of traffic testers. Their mothers would be pushing them along in their strollers--and they would come to a busy street with lots of parked cars--and the mother can't see what the traffic is like because of all the parked cars--so she just sort of edges the stroller out into the street and cranes her head out afterwards. And the most striking thing about this is the expression on these babies' faces as they sit there in the middle of traffic, stranded, banging those little gavels they've all got and they can't even speak EnglishDo you know what I mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I was a child, my mother said to me, Clean the plate, because children are starving in Europe. And I might point out that that was years before the Marshall Plan was ever heard of. So I would clean the plate, four, five, six times a day, because somehow I felt that that would keep the children from starving in Europe. But I was wrong. They kept starving. And I got fatSo I would like to say to every one of you who is either skinny or in some other way normal-- When you walk out on the street, and you see a fat person, Do not scoff at that fat person. Oh no! Take off your hat. Hold it over your heart. Lift your chin up high. And in a proud, happy voice say to himHail to thee, fat person!

Nine-tenths of the people of the free States look'd upon the rebellion, as started in South Carolina, from a feeling one-half of contempt, and the other half composed of anger and incredulity. It was not thought it would be join'd in by Virginia, North Carolina, or Georgia. A great and cautious national official predicted that it would blow over in sixty days, and folks generally believ'd the prediction.
